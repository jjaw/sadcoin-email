# Frontend Development Update

## 🌟 Project Overview

**SADCOIN presents: Let's Write An Email** - Frontend blockchain integration completed for the satirical email-writing experience by the SADCOIN Foundation.

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Blockchain Infrastructure Setup

* **Wagmi v2 Integration**: Configured React hooks for Ethereum interactions
* **Sepolia Testnet Configuration**: Set up development environment with proper network switching
* **Contract Integration**: Connected to deployed smart contracts with type-safe ABIs
* **WalletConnect Setup**: Implemented wallet connection with auto-network switching

### 2. Smart Contract Integration

**Deployed Contracts (Sepolia Testnet):**

* SADCoin Token: `0x7845B4894F2b2D2475314215163D797D4395d8Fb`
* FEELS Token: `0x4A679253410272dd5232B3Ff7cF5dbB88f295319`
* ConversionContract: `0x61fBE2CDa9d2a41c7A09843106eBD55A43790F54`

**Key Features Implemented:**

* Real-time token balance monitoring
* ETH to SADCoin purchase functionality
* FEELS to SADCoin conversion
* Chainlink price feed integration (ETH/USD)
* Purchase cooldown mechanics (24-hour)
* Event watching for live updates

### 3. React Hooks Architecture (`src/hooks/useContracts.ts`)

Created comprehensive contract interaction hooks:

* `useSADCoinBalance()` - Real-time SAD token balance
* `useFEELSBalance()` - Real-time FEELS token balance
* `usePurchaseCalculation()` - ETH to SAD conversion preview
* `usePurchaseSadness()` - Execute SAD token purchases
* `useConvertFeelsToSad()` - Convert FEELS to SAD tokens
* `useWatchSADTransfers()` - Live transfer event monitoring
* `useWatchSadnessPurchases()` - Live purchase event monitoring

### 4. Developer Tools & Debugging

**Debug Modal System:**

* Accessible via "🔧 DEBUG" button in navigation
* Modal-based interface to keep main CRT monitor clean
* Three integrated testing components

**PriceCalculator Component:**

* Real-time ETH/USD price display via Chainlink
* Purchase amount calculations
* Conversion rate monitoring
* Input validation and error handling

**SimpleTest Component:**

* Basic contract interaction testing
* Network status verification
* Transaction testing with status tracking

**DebugPanel Component:**

* Complete blockchain state monitoring
* Live balance updates with event watching
* Purchase testing with MetaMask integration
* Conversion testing for FEELS to SAD
* Cooldown period tracking
* Comprehensive error handling and status display

### 5. User Experience Improvements

* **Auto-Network Switching**: Automatically switches to Sepolia on wallet connection
* **Real-time Updates**: Live balance and status updates via blockchain events
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and user feedback
* **Status Tracking**: Real-time transaction status and confirmation monitoring
* **Responsive Design**: Clean terminal-style interface matching game aesthetic

### 7. Debug Modal Enhancements & Claim Flow Refactor

#### ✅ UI Logic Refactor

* **Claim Section Always Visible**: Removed old `sadBalance === '0.0' || '0'` conditional; now renders whenever `debugInfo.isConnected` is true.
* **`hasClaimed`-Driven State**: Button text and disabled state now depend on `hasClaimed`, not balance. This fixes the disappearing UI bug and ensures consistent behavior.

#### ✅ Purchase Flow Centralization

* **Click Handler Reorganization**: Moved `purchaseSadness()` call inside `handleClaimSADToken()` to ensure MetaMask prompt appears right after a successful faucet POST.
* **Old balance watcher removed**: Eliminated a `useEffect` previously used to monitor `sadBalance`, which intermittently failed and broke status updates.

#### ✅ Improved Status Messaging

* **ETH Confirmation Message**: Updated status to show: "ETH sent! (It can take up to a minute for the transaction to finalize.)"
* **Auto-Clear Statuses**: Added `useEffect` that clears both `claimStatus` and `autoPurchaseStatus` 60 seconds after any ✅ success or ❌ failure to prevent stale UI states.

#### ✅ Transaction Handling Fix

* **Fixed `tx.wait()` Error**: Diagnosed that `useWriteContract` returns only a transaction hash. Rewrote handler to drop `await tx.wait()`, use returned hash directly, and show it in UI without breaking the flow.

#### ✅ Component Patch Delivered

* **Updated `DebugModal.tsx` Supplied**: Provided the fully refactored modal with all improvements, including the stable hash-only transaction flow and cleaned-up logic.

#### ✅ Server-Client Separation Clarified

* **API = ETH Only**: Confirmed that the API route is responsible for sending ETH and recording claim state in SQLite only — it does *not* interact with MetaMask or perform token purchase.
* **Client = MetaMask Flow**: The on-chain `purchaseSadness()` call is handled fully in-browser using Wagmi and MetaMask.

#### ✅ MetaMask Behavior Explained

* **“Likely to fail” Warning**: Explained that this is a heuristic MetaMask gas simulation based on current network conditions — it’s often overly conservative.
* **Manual Gas Estimation**: Demonstrated how to call `publicClient.estimateGas()` to determine real gas cost.
* **Advanced Controls**: Walked through enabling MetaMask’s "Edit" (Advanced Gas Controls) to override base/max fees and manually drop to 1–2 Gwei
